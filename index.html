                I am passionate about using technology to create inclusive and positive impacts,
                inspired by my time as a classroom teacher. With a deep understanding of
                accessibility challenges, I bring a unique perspective to Niantic
                and am committed to building inclusive user experiences. I excel in
                collaborating with interdisciplinary teams, fostering communication,
                and driving projects forward. I enjoy the collaborative process where
                diverse perspectives come together to solve problems. Joining Niantic
                is an exciting chance to combine my skills with my commitment to accessibility.
                I believe my background, skills, and commitment to making a difference fit well
                with Niantic's mission, and I am eager to contribute to the company's endeavors.            </p>

            <p>
                I am a volunteer puppy raiser for Guide Dogs for the Blind.
                Guava is the first puppy I raised starting from the age of 2 months.
                She was career changed at 18 months, which means she simply decided guide work
                is not the right path for her and was dropped from the program.
                I am lucky enough to have adopted her and she is now a
                Cheng forever! Guava and I attend puppy club meetings regularly,
                help with puppies and their training, and I plan to raise another puppy
                in the near future!

            <h3>Therapy Work</h3>
            <p>
            Since Guava's career change, I have been training her to be certified
            as a therapy dog with Alliance of Therapy Dogs.
            Guava enjoys making new friends with everyone she
            meets and she also has a calm and sweet demeanor,
            the perfect temperament for a therapy dog.
            I am excited to spread Guava's joy during visits to hospitals, schools,
            nursing homes, and more to provide comfort and emotional support
            to my community.
