            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Ching! I am a software engineer who
                is passionate about debugging code, user
                experience, and accessibility. My passion
                for software engineering stems from my
                teaching background in public education and
                experience in a technology focused school.
                 I am currently raising a black lab puppy
                 for Guide Dogs for the Blind, where my
                 drive for accessibility comes from.
                 When I'm not at my desk, I'm probably
                 eating some good food, drinking boba,
                 working on a Studio Ghibli puzzle,
                 or hanging out with my puppy, Guava.
